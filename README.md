Character walking on terrain

You need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. For Linux, I recommend g++.

Please install the following libraries to compile the program:

GLM GLEW GLWF AND LASSIMP

Command to compile on the command line in Linux:
g++ main.cpp -o o -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw -lassimp

For Linux:

sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglfw3

sudo apt install libglm-dev

sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev

git clone https://github.com/nothings/stb.git

sudo cp stb/stb_image.h /usr/local/include/

If you are using Mac or Windows, install according to the recommendations for each system.
